        You retain your rights to any Content you submit, post or display on or
        through the Services. What&rsquo;s yours is yours &mdash; you own your
        Content (and your incorporated audio, photos and videos are considered
        part of the Content).
      </p>
      <p>
        By submitting, posting or displaying Content on or through the Services,
        you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the

        media or distribution methods now known or later developed (for clarity,
        these rights include, for example, curating, transforming, and
        translating). This license authorizes us to make your Content available
        to the rest of the world and to let others do the same. You agree that
        this license includes the right for Cicero to provide, promote, and
        improve the Services and to make Content submitted to or through the

        other companies, organizations or individuals, is made with no
        compensation paid to you with respect to the Content that you submit,
        post, transmit or otherwise make available through the Services as the
        use of the Services by you is hereby agreed as being sufficient
        compensation for the Content and grant of rights herein.Cicero has an
        evolving set of rules for how ecosystem partners can interact with your
        Content on the Services. These
      </p>
      <p>
        rules exist to enable an open ecosystem with your rights in mind. You
        understand that we may modify or adapt your Content as it is
        distributed, syndicated, published, or broadcast by us and our partners
        and/or make changes to your Content in order to adapt the Content to
        different media.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        You represent and warrant that you have, or have obtained, all rights,
        licenses, consents, permissions, power and/or authority necessary to
        grant the rights granted herein for any Content that you submit, post or
        display on or through the Services. You agree that such Content will not
        contain material subject to copyright or other proprietary rights,
        unless you have necessary permission or are otherwise legally entitled
        to post the material and to grant Cicero the license described above.
      </p>
      <p><strong>4. Using the Services</strong></p>
      <p>
        Please review the Cicero Rules and Policies, which are part of the User
        Agreement and outline what is prohibited on the Services. You may use
        the Services only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable
        laws,
      </p>
      <p>rules and regulations.</p>
      <p>
        Our Services evolve constantly. As such, the Services may change from
        time to time, at our discretion. We may stop (permanently or
        temporarily) providing the Services or any features within the Services
        to you or to users generally. We also retain the right to create limits
        on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time. We may also
        remove or refuse to distribute any Content on the Services, limit
        distribution or visibility of any Content on the service, suspend or
        terminate users, and reclaim usernames without liability to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        In consideration for Cicero granting you access to and use of the
        Services, you agree that Cicero and its third-party providers and
        partners may place advertising on the Services or in connection with the
        display of Content or information from the Services whether submitted by
        you or others. You also agree not to misuse our Services, for example,
        by interfering with them or accessing them using a method
      </p>
      <p>
        other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You agree
        that you will not work around any technical limitations in the software
        provided to you as part of the Services, or reverse engineer, decompile
        or disassemble the software, except and only to the extent that
        applicable law expressly permits. You may not do any of the following
        while accessing or using the Services: (i) access, tamper with, or use
        non-public areas of the Services, Cicero&rsquo;s computer systems, or
        the technical delivery systems of Cicero&rsquo;s providers; (ii) probe,
        scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or network or breach or
        circumvent any security or authentication measures; (iii) access or
        search or attempt to access or search the Services by any means
        (automated or otherwise) other than through our currently available,
        published interfaces that are provided by Cicero (and only pursuant to
        the applicable terms and conditions), unless you have been specifically
        allowed to do so in a separate agreement with Cicero (NOTE: crawling the
        Services is permissible if done in accordance with the provisions of the
        robots.txt file, however, scraping the Services without the prior
        consent of Cicero is expressly prohibited);<img
          src="missing.gif"
          alt=""
          width="611"
          height="18"
        />&nbsp;(iv) forge any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header
        information in any email or posting, or in any way use the Services to
        send altered, deceptive or false source-identifying information; or (v)
        interfere with, or disrupt, (or attempt to do so), the access of any
        user, host or network, including, without limitation, sending a virus,
        overloading, flooding, spamming, mail-bombing the Services, or by
        scripting the creation of Content in such a manner as to interfere with
        or create an undue burden on the Services. We also reserve the right to
        access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably
        believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation,
        legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce the Terms, including
        investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or
        otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to
        user support requests, or (v) protect the rights, property or safety of
        Cicero, its users and the public. Cicero does not disclose
        personally-identifying information to third parties except in accordance
        with our Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cicero may offer certain services or features for which additional terms
        and conditions may apply in connection with your use of those services.
        By using or paying for any of these additional services, you agree to
        any additional terms applicable to those services, and those additional
        terms become part of our agreement with you. If any of the applicable
        additional terms conflict with these Terms, the additional terms will
        prevail while you are using those services to which they apply.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you use paid features of the Services, you agree to the applicable
        Terms for Paid Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you use developer features of the Services, including but not limited
        to, you agree to our Developer Agreement and Developer Policy. If you
        want to reproduce, modify, create derivative works, distribute, sell,
        transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, or otherwise use
        the Services or Content on the Services, you must use the interfaces and
        instructions we provide, except as permitted through the Cicero Services
        or these Terms. If you are a security researcher, you are required to
        comply with the rules of the Cicero Vulnerability Reporting Program. The
        requirements set out in the preceding paragraph may not apply to those
        participating in Cicero&rsquo;s Vulnerability Reporting Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you use advertising features of the Services, you must agree to our
        Cicero Master Services Agreement.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p><strong>Your Account</strong></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        You may need to create an account to use some of our Services. You are
        responsible for safeguarding your account, so use a strong password and
        limit its use to this account. We cannot and will not be liable for any
        loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can control most communications from the Services. We may need to
        provide you with certain communications, such as service announcements
        and administrative messages. These communications are considered part of
        the Services and your account, and you may not be able to opt-out from
        receiving them. If you added your phone number to your account and you
        later change or deactivate that phone number, you must update your
        account information to help prevent us from communicating with anyone
        who acquires your old number.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Your License to Use the Services</strong></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Cicero gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and
        non- exclusive license to use the software provided to you as part of
        the Services. This license has the sole purpose of enabling you to use
        and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by Cicero, in the
        manner permitted by these Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of
        both the United States and other countries. Nothing in the Terms gives
        you a right to use the Cicero name or any of the Cicero trademarks,
        logos, domain names, other distinctive brand features, and other
        proprietary rights. All right, title, and interest in and to the
        Services (excluding Content provided by users) are and will remain the
        exclusive property of Cicero and its licensors. Any feedback, comments,
        or suggestions you may provide regarding Cicero, or the Services is
        entirely voluntary and we will be free to use such feedback, comments or
        suggestions as we see fit and without any obligation to you.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Ending These Terms</strong></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        You may end your legal agreement with Cicero at any time by deactivating
        your accounts and discontinuing your use of the Services.<img
          src="missing.gif"
          alt=""
          width="611"
          height="18"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        We may suspend or terminate your account or cease providing you with all
        or part of the Services at any time for any or no reason, including, but
        not limited to, if we reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these
        Terms or the Cicero Rules and Policies, (ii) you create risk or possible
        legal exposure for us; (iii) your account should be removed due to
        unlawful conduct, (iv) your account should be removed due to prolonged
        inactivity; or (v) our provision of the Services to you is no longer
        commercially viable. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you by
        the email address associated with your account or the next time you
        attempt to access your account, depending on the circumstances. In all
        such cases, the Terms shall terminate, including, without limitation,
        your license
      </p>
      <p>
        to use the Services, except that the following sections shall continue
        to apply: 2, 3, 5, and 6. If you believe your account was terminated in
        error you can file an appeal following the steps found in our Help
        Center. For the avoidance of doubt, these Terms survive the deactivation
        or termination of your account.
      </p>
      <p><strong>5. Disclaimers and Limitations of</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Liability</strong></p>
      <p><strong>The Services are Available &ldquo;AS-IS&rdquo;</strong></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Your access to and use of the Services or any Content are at your own
        risk. You understand and agree that the Services are provided to you on
        an &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; and &ldquo;AS AVAILABLE&rdquo; basis. The
        &ldquo;Cicero Entities&rdquo; refers to Cicero, its parents, affiliates,
        related companies, officers, directors, employees, agents,
        representatives, partners, and licensors. Without limiting the
        foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, THE
        CICERO ENTITIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS
        OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR
        NON-INFRINGEMENT. The Cicero Entities make no warranty or representation
        and disclaim all responsibility and liability for: (i) the completeness,
        accuracy, availability, timeliness, security or reliability of the
        Services or any Content; (ii) any harm to your computer system, loss of
        data, or other harm that results from your access to or use of the
        Services or any Content; (iii) the deletion of, or the failure to store
        or to transmit, any Content and other communications maintained by the
        Services; and (iv) whether the Services will meet your requirements or
        be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis. No advice
        or information, whether oral or written, obtained from the Cicero
        Entities or through the Services, will create any warranty or
        representation not expressly made herein.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE CICERO ENTITIES
        SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL
        OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PR OFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER
        INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSSOF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR
        OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (i) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR
        INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; (ii) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF
        ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
        DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD
        PARTIES; (iii) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE SERVICES; OR (iv)
        UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT.
        IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE CICERO ENTITIES EXCEED
        THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00) OR THE AMOUNT YOU
        PAID CICERO, IF ANY, IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE
        TO THE CLAIM. THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SUBSECTION SHALL APPLY TO ANY
        THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, STATUTE, TORT
        (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE CICERO
        ENTITIES HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGE, AND
        EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS
        ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
      </p>
      <p><strong>6. General</strong></p>
      <p>
        We may revise these Terms from time to time. The changes will not be
        retroactive, and the most current version of the Terms, which will
        always be at Cicero.com/tos, will govern our relationship with you. We
        will try to notify you of material revisions, for example via a service
        notification or an email to the email associated with your account. By
        continuing to access or use the Services after those revisions become
        effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The laws of the State of Delaware, excluding its choice of law
        provisions, will govern these Terms and any dispute that arises between
        you and Cicero. All disputes related to these Terms or the Services will
        be brought solely in the federal or state courts located in Delaware,
        United States, and you consent to personal jurisdiction and waive any
        objection as to inconvenient forum.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        If you are a federal, state, or local government entity in the United
        States using the Services in your official capacity and legally unable
        to accept the controlling law, jurisdiction or venue clauses above, then
        those clauses do not apply to you. For such U.S. federal government
        entities, these Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by
        the laws of the United States of America (without reference to conflict
        of laws) and, in the absence of federal law and to the extent permitted
        under federal law, the laws of the State of California (excluding choice
        of law).
      </p>
      <p>
        In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or
        unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the
        minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms
        will remain in full force and effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cicero&rsquo;s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms
        will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.
      </p>
      <p>
        These Terms are an agreement between you and Cicero Media, Inc. If you
        have any questions about these Terms, please contact us.

        display of Content or information from the Services whether submitted by

        by interfering with them or accessing them using a method other than the
        interface and the instructions that we provide. You agree that you will
        not work around any technical limitations in the software provided to

        the technical delivery systems of Cicero&rsquo;s providers; (ii) probe,
        scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or network or breach or
        circumvent any security or authentication measures; (iii) access or
        search or attempt to access or search the Services by any means
        (automated or otherwise) other than through our currently available,
        published interfaces that are provided by Cicero (and only pursuant to
        the applicable terms and conditions), unless you have been specifically
        allowed to do so in a separate agreement with Cicero (NOTE: crawling the
        Services is permissible if done in accordance with the provisions of the
        robots.txt file, however, scraping the Services without the prior
        consent of Cicero is expressly prohibited); (iv) forge any TCP/IP packet
        header or any part of the header information in any email or posting, or
        in any way use the Services to send altered, deceptive or false
        source-identifying information; or (v) interfere with, or disrupt, (or
        attempt to do so), the access of any user, host or network, including,
        without limitation, sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming,
        mail-bombing the Services, or by scripting the creation of&nbsp;Content
        in such a manner as to interfere with or create an undue burden on the
        Services. We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and
        disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i)
        satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental
        request, (ii) enforce the Terms, including investigation of potential
        violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud,
        security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or
        (v) protect the rights, property or safety of Cicero, its users and the
        public. Cicero does not disclose personally-identifying information to
        third parties except in accordance with our Privacy Policy.

        any additional terms applicable to those services, and those additional
        terms become part of our agreement with you. If any of the applicable

        Terms for Paid Services.

      <p>
        You can control most communications from the Services. We may need to
        provide you with certain communications, such as service announcements
        and administrative messages. These communications are considered part of
        the
      </p>
      <p>
        Services and your account, and you may not be able to opt-out from
        receiving them. If you added your phone number to your account and you
        later change or deactivate that phone number, you must update your
        account information to help prevent us from communicating with anyone
        who acquires your old number.

      <p><strong>Your License to Use the Services</strong></p>
      <p></p>

        Cicero gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and
        non- exclusive license to use the software provided to you as part of
        the Services. This license has the sole purpose of enabling you to use
        and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by Cicero, in the
        manner permitted by these Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of
        both the United States and other countries. Nothing in the Terms gives
        you a right to use the Cicero name or any of the Cicero trademarks,
        logos, domain names, other distinctive brand features, and other
        proprietary rights. All right, title, and interest in and to the
        Services (excluding Content provided by users) are and will remain the
        exclusive property of Cicero and its licensors. Any feedback, comments,
        or suggestions you may provide regarding Cicero, or the Services is
        entirely voluntary and we will be free to use such feedback, comments or
        suggestions as we see fit and without any obligation to you.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Ending These Terms</strong></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        You may end your legal agreement with Cicero at any time by deactivating
        your accounts and discontinuing your use of the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may suspend or terminate your account or cease providing you with all
        or part of Services at any time for any or no reason, including, but not
        limited to, if we reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these Terms
        or the Cicero Rules and Policies, (ii) you create risk or possible legal
        exposure for us; (iii) your account should be removed due to unlawful
        conduct, (iv) your account should be removed due to prolonged
        inactivity; or (v) our provision of the Services to you is no longer
        commercially viable. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you by
        the email address associated with your account or the next time you
        attempt to access your account, depending on the circumstances. In all
        such cases, the Terms shall terminate, including, without limitation,
        your license to use the Services, except that the following sections
        shall continue to apply: 2, 3, 5, and 6. If you believe your account was
        terminated in error you can file an appeal following the steps found in
        our Help Center. For the avoidance of doubt, these Terms survive the
        deactivation or termination of your account.
      </p>
      <p><strong>5. Limitation of Liability</strong></p>
      <p>
        By using the Services you agree that Cicero, its parents, affiliates,
        related companies, officers, directors, employees, agents
        representatives, partners and licensors, liability is limited to the
        maximum extent permissible in your country of residence.
      </p>
      <p><strong>6. General</strong></p>
      <p>
        We may revise these Terms from time to time. The changes will not be
        retroactive, and the most current version of the Terms, which will
        always be at getcicero.io/tos, will govern our relationship with you.
        Other than for changes addressing new functions or made for legal
        reasons, we will notify you 30 days in advance of making effective
        changes to these Terms that impact the rights or obligations of any
        party to these Terms, for example via a service notification or an email
        to the email associated with your account. By continuing to access or
        use the Services after those revisions become effective, you agree to be
        bound by the revised Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or
        unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the
        minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms
        will remain in full force and effect. Cicero&rsquo;s failure to enforce
        any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of
        such right or provision.

        <strong>
          Cicero&rsquo;s purpose is to serve the public discourse and to bring
          the public square online. Violence, harassment, threats and other

          themselves, and ultimately diminish the value of global public
          conversation. Our rules are to ensure all people can participate in
          the public conversation freely and safely.

      <h1><strong>CICERO POLICIES</strong></h1>
      <h2><strong>CONDUCT AND BEHAVIOR</strong></h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        To ensure a safe and vibrant platform for the exchange and debate of
        ideas, Cicero has adopted several rules and policies. While we aim to
        encourage free speech and the exchange of various points of view, we
        want to do so in a manner that does not cheapen, influence or otherwise
        negatively affect the perspectives of others through threatening or
        abusive behavior. As such, we will continue to update these rules and
        policies and they will remain subject to change as are the guidelines
        for enforcing them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cicero&rsquo;s mission is to give everyone a voice and an opportunity to
        share their opinions, ideas and information without concern for
        retribution or punitive repercussions. Free speech and free expression
        are human rights and should not be infringed upon, except in the most
        extreme of circumstances. Cicero is a private company and therefore not
        subject to the same restraints and limitations of enforcement as the
        government; however, in determining what speech is allowable, we do use
        constitutional logic and reasoning as a guide. We believe that everyone
        has a right to be heard, even if those views are deemed offensive by
        others, so long as those views do not amount to the hateful conduct
        stated above. Our goal is to establish a platform for dialogue and
        reasoned debate and to bring what used to be localized conversations
        into a broader digital space, which requires representation of a diverse
        range of backgrounds, thoughts and perspectives.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        We recognize that if people experience abuse on Cicero, it can
        jeopardize their ability to express themselves. We do believe that ideas
        should, at times, be provocative, thought-provoking and uncomfortable,
        and that such a position can be consistent with not allowing reasonable
        people to feel threatened or marginalized. Regardless of immutable or
        chosen preferences ranging from gender, and race to religion and
        nationality, we believe that everyone deserves an open forum to
        challenge ideas and voice their positions without fear, even if apposite
        to the social norms and cultural zeitgeist. That is, after all, how we
        maintain our traditions while concurrently evolving as a society.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are committed to combating abuse motivated by hatred, prejudice or
        intolerance, particularly abuse that seeks to silence the voices of
        those who have been otherwise marginalized whether from a reasonable,
        well-founded fear of persecution or retaliation. For this reason, we
        prohibit behavior that&nbsp;targets individuals or groups with abuse
        based on their perceived membership in one of the Categories (as defined
        herein).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><u>ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR</u></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >CICERO RULE: You may not engage in ad hominem attacks or the targeted
          harassment of someone, or incite other people to do so. We consider
          abusive behavior an attempt to harass, intimidate, or silence someone
          else&rsquo;s voice.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        On Cicero, you should feel safe expressing your unique point of view. We
        believe in freedom of expression and open dialogue, but that means
        little as an underlying philosophy if voices are silenced because people
        are afraid to speak up.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to facilitate healthy dialogue on the platform, and empower
        individuals to express diverse opinions and beliefs, we prohibit
        behavior that harasses or intimidates, or is otherwise intended to shame
        or degrade others. Such behavior lowers the quality of debate and
        attacks on people&rsquo;s physical appearances, ethnicity, religion,
        gender or sexuality are distractions that deflect from what are
        typically weak arguments; hence, negatively affecting the conversation.
        In addition to cheapening the debate, such abusive behavior poses risks
        to people&rsquo;s safety, and may also lead to physical and emotional
        hardship for those affected.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><strong>When does behavior amount to abuse?</strong></p>
      <p>
        Some comments or statements may seem to be abusive when viewed in
        isolation, but may not be when viewed in the context of a larger
        conversation. When we review this type of content, it may not be clear
        whether it is intended to harass an individual based on his or her
        membership of a Protected Category, or if it is part of a consensual
        conversation. To help our teams understand the context of a
        conversation, we may contact the person being targeted to investigate
        his or her perspective and the intent behind the statement or comment
        prior to taking any disciplinary action.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will take any disciplinary actions we deem necessary following a
        review of any reports of accounts targeting individuals or groups of
        people exhibiting the following behavior:
      </p>
      <p>&middot; Engaging in abusive behavior on a user&rsquo;s profile.</p>
      <p>
        &middot; Targeting people based on their race, ethnicity, national

      <p>
        <strong>Violent threats</strong>: We prohibit content that makes violent
        threats against a specific person or group of persons. Violent threats

      <p><strong>Incitement against protected categories</strong></p>
      <p>
        We prohibit inciting behavior that targets individuals or groups of

        intended:
      </p>
      <p>
        &middot; to incite fear or spread fearful stereotypes about a
        <a name="_Hlk129110993"></a>Protected Category, including asserting that

        dangerous or illegal activities.

        &middot; to incite others to discriminate against a member of Protected
        Category, which may include imposing economic harm because of a
        person&rsquo;s perceived membership in a Protected Category. A possible
        exception to this rule, however, is language deemed to be political in
        nature or other means of commentary relating to legitimate boycotts or
        protests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that content intended to incite violence against a Protected

        <br />
        We prohibit targeting others with repeated slurs, tropes or other
        content that intends to dehumanize, degrade or reinforce negative or
        harmful stereotypes about a protected category. This includes targeted
        misgendering or deadnaming of transgender individuals. We also prohibit

        racist/sexist tropes where the primary intent is to harass or intimidate
        others, we may require removal of said content. In other cases, such as

        Hateful imagery can consist of symbols, logos, graffiti, or any other

      </p>
      <p>&middot; symbols that have been associated with hate groups;</p>
      <p>

        symbols typically associated with a Protected Category that have
        otherwise been altered to include hateful symbols or references to a
        mass murder that targeted a Protected Category (such as a noose or
        yellow star).
      </p>
      <p>
        Media depicting hateful imagery is not permitted within live video,

        Healthy dialogue is only possible when people feel safe from abuse and
        do not resort to using violent language. At Cicero, we are about ideas,
        and fostering an environment where the free flow of such ideas can
        stimulate effective and entertaining debate. To achieve that goal, we
        have a policy against threatening others, defined as statements of an
        intent to kill or inflict serious physical harm on a specific person or
        group of people.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>

          policy?</strong

      </p>
      <p>
        Under this policy, you cannot state an intention to inflict violence on
        a specific person or group of people. We define intent to include
        statements like &ldquo;I will&rdquo;, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to&rdquo;,
        or &ldquo;I plan to&rdquo;, as well as conditional statements like
        &ldquo;If you do X, I will&rdquo;. Violations of this policy include,
        but are not limited to:
      </p>
      <p>&middot; threatening to kill someone;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        &middot; threatening to assault someone, whether sexually, physically,
        psychologically or any other manner;

        &middot; threatening to seriously hurt someone and/or commit another

        injury; and

        We recognize that violent language has become part of the vernacular,
        often intended as an expression or hyperbole. As a result, some forms of
        speech otherwise deemed &ldquo;violent&rdquo;, might be allowed where it
        is otherwise reasonably clear that there is no abusive or violent
        intent.&nbsp;

      <p>
        This policy is enforced in tandem with our policies on&nbsp;abusive
        behavior&nbsp;and&nbsp;hateful conduct provided herein. Statements that
        express a wish or hope that someone experiences physical harm, making
        vague or indirect threats, or threatening actions that are unlikely to
        cause serious or lasting injury are not actionable under this policy,
        but may be reviewed and actioned under those policies.&nbsp;

      </p>
      <p>
        We recognize that conversations regarding certain individuals credibly
        accused of severe violence may prompt outrage and associated wishes of
        harm. In these limited cases, we reserve the right to delete the content
        at our discretion without any risk of account penalty, suspension, or
        termination. Such statements like &ldquo;All rapists should die&rdquo;
        would fall under this exception.&nbsp;

        Cicero is intended to facilitate the open flow of ideas. As a society,
        we have been forced into silos that have become echo chambers that have
        stymied our ability to consider other perspectives, particularly if
        those views are deemed &ldquo;offensive.&rdquo; One of the byproducts of
        that has been an oversensitivity to ideas or opinions that are contrary
        to our own. To combat, and hopefully begin the process of reversing,
        such thin-skinned if not irascible behavior, we will remove your ability
        to flag users for violations if you present yourself as unable to
        tolerate or sustain an otherwise inviolate position of another person.

        temporarily remove your ability to tag in or create a Rō before you can
        participate again. If you continue to violate this policy after
        receiving a warning, your account will be suspended and or terminated.

        When determining the penalty for violating this policy, we consider
        several factors including, but not limited to, the severity of the
        violation and an individual&rsquo;s previous record of rule violations.
        The following is a list of potential enforcement options for content
        that violates this policy:
      </p>
      <p>
        &middot; Reducing the ranking in users&rsquo; feeds of the video at
        issue, except when the user follows the video creator.
      </p>
      <p>
        &middot; Not including problematic video clips for amplification in the
        search results and/or on timelines for users who don&rsquo;t follow the
        video creator.
      </p>
      <p>
        &middot; Excluding content and/or accounts in email or in-product
        recommendations.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>&middot; Removing the video in its entirety.</p>

      <h1>Standards Against Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE)</h1>

      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Cicero Media, Inc. (“Cicero”) is committed to maintaining a safe and
        secure platform that protects children from exploitation, abuse, and
        harm. We strictly prohibit any form of Child Sexual Abuse and
        Exploitation (CSAE) and take all necessary steps to prevent, detect, and
        report such content and activity on our platform.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Zero-Tolerance Policy on Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM)</h2>
      <p>
        Cicero enforces a zero-tolerance policy against Child Sexual Abuse
        Material (CSAM). This includes but is not limited to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Any content that depicts, encourages, or facilitates child sexual
          abuse or exploitation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any attempt to groom, solicit, or engage minors in inappropriate
          conversations or activities.
        </li>
        <li>The sharing, storage, or transmission of CSAM in any form.</li>
        <li>
          The use of the platform for the recruitment or facilitation of child
          trafficking or exploitation.
        </li>

      <h2>3. Proactive Detection and Reporting</h2>
      <p>
        To ensure compliance and prevent CSAE, Cicero implements the following
        measures:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Automated Scanning & Moderation:</strong> We use AI-driven and
          manual review processes to detect and remove any content that violates
          child safety policies.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>User Reporting Mechanisms:</strong> Users can report any
          suspected CSAE content directly within the app, which will be reviewed
          and actioned promptly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Collaboration with Law Enforcement:</strong> We cooperate with
          global law enforcement agencies and organizations like the National
          Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) to report and act on
          any CSAM-related incidents.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Strict Content Moderation:</strong> All user-generated content
          (UGC) is subject to review by our trust and safety team to identify
